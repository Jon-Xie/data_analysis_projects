Since the only revenue source for our app will be in-app advertisements, I recommend we build a simple yet highly rewarding video game for all audiences (youth-friendly). It wouldn't make sense for us to target a market segment with moderately low average downloads, as the audience for such markets are naturally smaller. As we discovered, categories and genres are dominated by several outliers, which tremendously skew the averages of installs per category. Finding an untapped niche for a highly successful app profile will require greater analysis. This project was simply an exercise to practice analysis without a Python library like Pandas. "
